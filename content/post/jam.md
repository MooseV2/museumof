Analyzing something from multiple perspectives is a foundational skill of healthy societies in the 21st century. The Museum of Brick will explore the word "brick" from multiple perspectives in the format of an interactive exhibit (pop-up museum). Activities in each section of the museum will provide opportunities for people to critically explore a subject while developing professional skills and new relationships.
This design jam will prompt groups to build out an installation for one section of the museum. 
Sections include;

* brick as a construction material,
* LEGO bricks,
* Bricked technology,
* BRICK shots in basketball

### Timeline
We may repeat this design jam or conduct a larger hack-a-thon over the Winter to generate a range of installations to select from. Installations need to be created and tested by the widest range of Torontonians to see if they fulfill the design specs and mission of the museum. The most engaging and feasible installations will be included in the Museum of Brick to launch in Spring 2020. Possible venues include Evergreen Brickworks, The Brick furniture stores, Heritage Museums of Toronto, and some unconventional spaces.

### Background
Museum of Brick is the first in a series of activations from [Museum.Of](https://museum.of.ca). We aim to facilitate opportunities for interaction between people, concepts and tools that inspire critical thinking, creativity and relationship building across demographics. We believe that shared experiences like these will elevate the social capital and cohesion of our city.
