Museum.Of aims to facilitate opportunities for interaction between people, concepts and tools that inspire critical thinking, creativity and relationship building across demographics. We believe that shared experiences like these will elevate the social capital and cohesion of our city.

# Why are you making a museum?
Museums offer safe spaces to learn and explore different perspectives. We
want to facilitate opportunities for people to learn from/with others so as to
build the social cohesion of Toronto.

# Who are you?
We are an experiment called Museum.Of. We aim to facilitate opportunities
for interaction between people, concepts and tools that inspire critical
thinking, creativity and relationship building across demographics. 

# Why is there reference to a Museum of Brick on the first page?
Museum of Brick is the first in a series of activations from Museum.Of.  It could have been another word that we chose to play with, but we felt that given Toronto's buildings are mostly made of brick, it would be easier to draw a parallel to the various venues that could house a museum about the word "brick".  We prototyped what this museum could look like at a design jam ("https://museumof.ca/post/post/") we held in November 2019.
